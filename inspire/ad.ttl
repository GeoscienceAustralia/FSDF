# This is a draft RDF vocabulary for representing spatial data sets in INSPIRE as RDF. This vocabulary has been created using the "Guidelines for the RDF encoding of spatial data" (http://inspire-eu-rdf.github.io/inspire-rdf-guidelines).
#
# The use of RDF is optional and does not supersede or replace the requirements regarding encoding specified in Clause 9 of the INSPIRE Data Specifications. This optional encoding is intended to support the e-government and open data community in Europe, which is increasingly looking at RDF to represent data.
#
# This is a draft version. It has limitations and is expected to contain errors. Please report any issues or concerns in GitHub (https://github.com/inspire-eu-rdf/inspire-rdf-vocabularies/issues).
#
# ------------------------------
#
#
# This ontology contains classes and properties that have been derived from the INSPIRE "Addresses" application schema.
#
# During the derivation, the following mappings, alignments, and omissions have been applied:
# - Mappings:
#   - Code list values are mapped to skos:Concept.
#   - The properties 'beginLifespanVersion', 'endLifespanVersion', 'validFrom', and 'validTo' are mapped to the global properties defined by the base ontology.
#   - Geometry types are mapped to classes from the Simple Feature ontology.
#
# - Alignments (through subsumption):
#   - Spatial object types are aligned with gsp:Feature.
#   - Type 'Address' is aligned with locn:Address.
#   - Type 'ThoroughfareNameValue' is aligned with gn:GeographicalName
#   - Properties of spatial object types with value type 'GeographicalName' are aligned to property locn:geographicName.
#   - Properties with a geometry value type are aligned to locn:geometry and gsp:hasDefaultGeometry.
#
# - Omissions:
#   - Property 'inspireId' is omitted. See the guidelines for further details.
#   - Property 'ThoroughfareNameValue.name' is omitted.
#   - Type 'AddressRepresentation' is omitted. Whenever this type is used as value type, then in the RDF encoding the RDF implementation of type 'Address' is used. For further details, see the guidelines.
#
# - Restructuring:
#   - Property 'GeographicPosition.default' is transformed into a new property 'defaultPosition' on class 'Address'.

According to the most common rule, an address number should be unique within the scope of the thoroughfare name. In other areas the address number is unique inside an address area name (e.g. the name of the village) or postal designator (e.g. the post code). In some areas even a combination of rules are applied: e.g. addresses with two locators, each of them referencing to a separate address component. \r\n\r\nNOTE 2 Locators that has the level of unit (like e.g. floor identifier and door or unit identifiers) are most often assigned so that they are unambiguous within the more narrow scope of the property or building; for these locators the association should therefore not be populated. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1 In a typical European address dataset, parts of the addresses have locators which are unambiguous within the scope of the road name (thoroughfare name) while others are unambiguous within the name ogf the village or district (address area name). \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2 In Lithuania and Estonia a concept of \"corner addresses\" exists. Corner addresses have two address numbers (designators) each of them referring to a thoroughfare name (primary and secondary street name). E.g. in Vilnius the address designated \"A. Stulginskio gatve 4 / A. Smetonos gatve 7\" is situated on the corner of the two streets. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3 In the Czech Republic in some cities an address has two locator designators: A building number which referres to the address area (district, cz: \"cast obce\") and a address number that referres to the thoroughfare name. As an example in Praha for address designated \"Na PankrÃ¡ci 1690/125, Nusle\" the designator \"1690\" is a building number unique within the address area (cz cast obce) \"Nusle\", while the \"125\" is an address number that has the thoroughfare name as its scope."@en ;

In addition to these common locator types, also narrative or descriptive locators are possible.\r\n\r\nNOTE 4 The locators of an address could be composed as a hierarchy, where one level of locators identifies the real property or building while another level of locators identifies the flats or dwellings inside the property. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1 In a Spanish city a \"site-level\" locator could identify a building on the thoroughfare name \"Calle Gran VÃ­a using the address number \"8\". If the building has four entrance doors, the door number \"3\" could be the \"access-level\" locator. The 3rd door could, via two staircases \"A\" and \"B\", give access to a number of floors, identified by a number \"1\" to \"5\" on which a number of dwellings are situated, also identified by numbers \"1\" to \"3\"; The \"unit level\" locator will thus composed of staircase-, floor- and dwelling identification e.g. \"staircase A, floor 5, dwelling 1\". In total, the three parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2 In Copenhagen an \"access level\" locator could identify a specific entrance door in a building on the thoroughfare name \"Wildersgade\" using the address number \"60A\" (In Denmark the optional suffix is a part of the address number). The entrance door gives access to a number of floors, e.g, \"st\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", on which two dwellings are situated \"tv\" and \"th\". The \"unit level\" locator will thus be composed by a floor- and a door identifier: \"2. th.\" (2nd floor, door to the right). In total, the two parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3 In The Netherlands only one level of locators exists.

Consequently, there is not often a tight relationship between the postal areas and administrative units in the same area.\r\n\r\nNOTE 4 The structure schema and formats of national postal descriptor systems are different. Sometimes (for example in the UK) the post code itself is the only information required for a valid address; in other situations both the post code and the associated name of post office or town is required. Sometimes there is a simple relationship between the code and the name; in other situations a set of postcodes are associated with a single post office or town.\r\n\r\nNOTE 5 In some countries like e.g. The Republic of Ireland, no post code system currently exists, therefore the postal descriptor is only represented by the name of the post town. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1 In the UK the post code \"EC4M 7DR\" is sufficient, as a postal descriptor, while the related town name \"London\" is informative, but not necessary in the postal address. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2 In Sweden all postcodes starting with \"80\" is related to the postal name \"GÃ¤vle\". Therefore in the postal descriptor \"802 74 GÃ¤vle\", the postcode \"802 74\" bears all postal necessary information, while the town name \"GÃ¤vle\" is extra information. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3 In Denmark, outside the centre of Copenhagen, each postcode has a 1:1 relationship to one post name only: Postcode \"6372\" relates to the village \"Bylderup-Bov\". \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 4 In Germany the lowest level of the Postal descriptor (the 5 digit Postleitzahl) often does not fall within an administrative unit (e.g. municipality). The Postleitzahl is handled completely independent from the hierarchal systematic of the addresses. In addition, some \"Postleitzahlen\" represent not a delivery area, but institutions with a big amount of post."@en ;

In other countries, the concept of address area names is less strict and based on local tradition or specific needs. \r\n\r\nNOTE 2 In some situations an address area name is not required to obtain unambiguousness; instead the purpose is to make the complete address more informative and descriptive, adding a well known place name (e.g. of a village or community) to the address. This is particularly useful if the municipality or post code covers a large area. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1 In Sweden a \"Kommundel\" (en: Municipal sub division) is a type of address area names that ensures that street names are unique within the sub division. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2 In Spain an \"Entidad de poblaciÃ³n\" (en: population entity) has the same function. It is the general address area which depending on its characteristics can be classified as \"Entidad Singular\" (en: singular entity) or \"Entidad Colectiva\" (en: collective entity). Moreover, according to the population distribution, these areas can contain one or several \"NÃºcleo de poblaciÃ³n\" (en: population core) and/or \"PoblaciÃ³n diseminada\" (en: scattered population).\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3 In Denmark \"Supplerende bynavn\" (en: Supplementary town name) is sometimes compulsory to ensure uniqueness of street names within the post code, sometimes it is just useful extra information, that makes the address more informative."@en ;

It should, however, be noted that in different countries and regions, different traditions and/or regulations determine which object types should be regarded as addressable objects. \r\n\r\nNOTE 2 In most situations the addressable objects are current, real world objects. However, addresses may also reference objects which are planned, under construction or even historical.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3 Apart from the identification of the addressable objects (like e.g. buildings), addresses are very often used by a large number of other applications to identify object types e.g. statistics of the citizens living in the building, for taxation of the business entities that occupy the building, and the utility installations. \r\n\r\nNOTE 4 For different purposes, the identification of an address can be represented in different ways (see example 3). \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1 A property can e.g., be a plot of land, building, part of building, way of access or other construction,\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2 In the Netherlands the primary addressable objects are buildings and dwellings which may include parts of buildings, mooring places or places for the permanent placement of trailers (mobile homes), in the UK it is the lowest level of unit for the delivery of services, in the Czech Republic it is buildings and entrance doors. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3 Addresses can be represented differently.
