# FSDF model at feature level

FSDF model at feature level defines the properties attached to the FSDF features (e.g. facilities, powerlines, power stations)

The FSDF feature level model has been adapted from the attributes of the following datasets:

- [FSDF facilities schema](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/FSDF-Facilities)
- [FSDF powerinfrastructure schema](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/FSDF-PowerInfrastructure)

The mdoel is summarized in this figure:
